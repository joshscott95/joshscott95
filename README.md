- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Joshua Scott
I'm currently improving my coding skills by colloborating on pretty basic full stack web apps.
My most recent project is an Auto dealership management app. I utilize Python/Django for the back end and React on the front end. The back end has two microservices that both use a poller script to query data using API calls to the inventory project. The front is completely bare with no UI addition.
